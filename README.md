CONTEXT
-------
The project at https://github.com/pal-16/event was developed under *Inheritance* 2019, a Summer Mentorship Programme under *Community of Coders*, VJTI. <br>
The team of contributors to the original repository was assigned a mentor for the project. 
<br>

PURPOSE
-------
In addition to my previous experience with the domain, as the mentor for *Trinity* I felt that I would be able to have a more first-hand experience of their errors if I work on a similar project laterally and equip me better to solve the issues in *Trinity*'s project, if any. <br>
*This fork was not intended as a guide, reference, or source and was created for personal experimentation.*
